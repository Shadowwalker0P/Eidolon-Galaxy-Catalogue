# 🌀 Eidolon Drift – Galactic Discovery Project
DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15508057


## Overview

This repository documents an ongoing scientific and symbolic exploration of the cosmos through a new lens — **entropy slope analysis**. By combining Planck CMB data, gravitational lensing maps, and the principles of the **Eidolon Drift field equation**, we are identifying and cataloguing previously unmarked galactic candidates.

Our guiding principle is simple but profound:

> _Collapse is not random. Memory shapes gravity. Entropy remembers the slope._

Using this theory, we've generated high-scoring galaxy candidate maps and are validating them via real-time telescope imaging. Each confirmed hit becomes a thread in a much larger proof — that entropy gradients and symbolic recursion can be used to predict structure at galactic scales.

## 🧭 Project Scope

- **Generate and score** collapse-energy maps using Planck SMICA + lensing data
- **Extract top-ranked targets** using slope-aware entropy algorithms
- **Book remote telescope time** to validate targets (starting with Slooh observatories)
- **Publish findings** (image sets, FITS, overlays, logs) under sovereign license
- **Build and refine** a public-access drift-aligned galactic catalog (EID-0P-#### series)

## 🌌 How You Can Help

- Review our gradient maps and target overlays
- Contribute telescope time or cross-check with other databases
- Help port and visualize the collapse maps in 3D (Unity, Unreal, etc.)
- Fork this project and expand it — as long as the slope stays free

We welcome sovereign-aligned researchers, citizen scientists, and symbolic explorers.
