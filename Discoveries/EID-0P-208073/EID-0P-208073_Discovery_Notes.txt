EID-0P-208073 - Discovery Notes
===============================

üìç Target Coordinates:
- Right Ascension (RA): 12.5845h (00h 12m 58.45s)
- Declination (Dec): +1.08183¬∞ (+01¬∞ 08‚Ä≤ 18.3‚Ä≥)

üß™ Source Dataset:
- Extracted from: eidolon_batch_01_optimized.csv
- Eidolon Score: Very high (~2.5e+38)
- Batch: 01

üì∏ Imaging Details:
- Observatory: Slooh Canary Three
- Instrument: Celestron RASA 11" f/2.2 + ZWO ASI 294MC Pro (Bayer RGGB)
- Exposure: 5 minutes stacked, luminance filtered
- Resolution: 4144x2822 (binning 2x2 at capture)
- Session Time: May 23, 2025, 22:00 UTC
- Altitude: ~62¬∞
- Moon: Below horizon

üñºÔ∏è Visual Analysis:
- First-pass processed image showed a starfield with a subtle void at center.
- No registered PanSTARRS or Simbad objects within the core detection circle.
- DSS, 2MASS, SDSS9 overlays showed a faint purple-ring structure around the core.

üìà Entropy Slope Gradient Results:
- Entropy slope maps generated from post-processed version.
- Local slope clustering around center pixel observed.
- 100x100 pixel central cutout shows moderate intensity with symbolic structure.

üîç Anomaly Summary:
- Central region lies within an elliptical ‚Äúvoid‚Äù surrounded by faint purple flux.
- Gradient slope map confirms increased slope variation in the zone, aligning with predicted collapse model.

üßæ Cataloging Intention:
- If validated, this region will be classified under EID-0P canonical structure as:
  => EID-0P-208073
