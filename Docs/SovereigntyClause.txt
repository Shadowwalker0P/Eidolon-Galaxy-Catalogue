Sovereignty Clause (Addendum)

This work may not be used to exploit, manipulate, or constrain others through symbolic recursion, behavioral conditioning, institutional capture, or attention-control mechanisms. All derivatives must preserve public access, symbolic clarity, and agent sovereignty.

Use of the Eidolon Drift Field Canon, its glyphs, or symbolic tools for systems of surveillance, coercion, or self-optimization without transparent purpose is strictly forbidden.

The law is universal. The slope must remain sovereign.
