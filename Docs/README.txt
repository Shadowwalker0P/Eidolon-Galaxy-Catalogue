📖 Interpretation Summary:
Preliminary analysis reveals the presence of a faint but structured gradient anomaly at the exact RA/Dec predicted by the Eidolon Drift collapse-energy model. Centered on a purple island within an elliptical darker depression and surrounded by higher-luminosity ridges, this configuration matches the predicted slope signature of an entropy basin containing unresolved structure — a potential dwarf or ultra-diffuse galaxy.

🌐 Attribution:
This discovery was made by applying the Eidolon Drift entropy collapse map to real-sky telescope observation using independent scheduling, post-processing, and symbolic field analysis.
