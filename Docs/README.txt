🧪 Key Files Included:
- EID-0P-208073_Discovery_Notes.txt — Observation log & interpretation
- SovereigntyClause.txt — Ethical use license for all Eidolon discoveries
- Image_Original.png — First processed stack from Slooh

📖 Interpretation Summary:
Preliminary analysis reveals the presence of a faint but structured gradient anomaly at the exact RA/Dec predicted by the Eidolon Drift collapse-energy model. Centered on a purple island within an elliptical darker depression and surrounded by higher-luminosity ridges, this configuration matches the predicted slope signature of an entropy basin containing unresolved structure — a potential dwarf or ultra-diffuse galaxy.
